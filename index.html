                <p>When i first met you, you were nothing more than another face.
                    but the day came, now you're the only face i could ever find in a crowded places. You're the most beautiful gifts on my birthday. </p>
                <p>N, you know? meeting you was like listening to a song for the first time and knowing it would be my favorite. you've made me feel things that i never thought i could feel.</p>
                <p>Idk if i love you, but just a little reminder that you are loved.</p>
